This is the course page
for the seminar course
_Deep Learning for Linguistics_
at the [Department of Linguistics](http://sfs.uni-tuebingen.de),
[University of Tübingen](http://uni-tuebingen.de).

**This page is under construction, please visit later for more details.**

In early years of (computational) linguistics,
it was common to study linguistics with an expectation
to apply it for natural language processing (NLP)
for practical applications.
In the past 30-40 years, the use of data-driven methods in NLP
separated both fields considerably,
and with recent domination of the field by end-to-end systems
with little linguistic knowledge or insight,
the distance has increased even further.
In this course, our focus will be the inverse of the expectation above:
we will explore the ways we can use the modern data-driven methods
to support linguistic research.

The course is organized in two parts.
The first part is a series of lectures introducing
modern machine learning methods in an accessible and practical manner.
In the second part,
the participants are expected to apply the methods they learned
on small research projects on a broad range of linguistic problems,
and discuss their approaches and results in the class.

Grading will be based on class participation and homeworks (6ECTS).
Further course credits (9ECTS in total) can be obtained through
a term project described in a term paper within the scope of the course.

## Requirements

The participants should be able to read and write programs in Python,
and they should be familiar with basic probability and statistics.
